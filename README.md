Network sniffer for credentials

1.     Sniff packets on known network (Ethical Hacking wifi) using Wireshark
2.     Grab the unencrypted data passed over the network, and the most popular websites used from the sniffed packets and save as file
3.     If necessary create our own website/traffic to ensure that we have unencrypted data
4.     Use Hydra to try unencrypted data as usernames on most used websites
